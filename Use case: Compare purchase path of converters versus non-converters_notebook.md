## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose

This IQ helps advertisers evaluate engagement patterns between the two groups following either first campaign exposure, detail page view, or branded search. Evaluate the differences between the two groups and optimize your media mix, impression frequency, and remarketing strategy. 

This IQ answers questions such as: 

* What are the average days to purchase? 
* What ad products are driving purchases? 
* What is the ideal impression level per ad product?

![diagram 2](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/adsamciql/compare_path_3_med.png)

### Requirements

* **On-Amazon conversions:** This query relies on ASIN conversions on Amazon. It is therefore limited to advertisers with on-Amazon conversions.
* **Enrollment (trial or subscription) to Flexible Shopping Insights (FSI) as a part of Amazon Insights**: Paid Features are only available in certain regions.

## Data query instructions

### Data returned

The query results are segmented by users that had a purchase conversion (`customer_type = Purchase`) following campaign exposure versus those that did not convert (`customer_type = No Purchase`). 
 
The query returns:

* Average days to purchase per user
* Average number of ad product types exposed per user
* Average number of impression events per user
* Average number of impression events per ad product type per user
* Average number of brand detail page views per user
* Average number of brand products considered per user

### Tables used

* [sponsored_ads_traffic](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/sponsored_ads_traffic): This data source is used for sponsored ads traffic. From this table, we are using user_id and impression_dt to identify who was exposed and when, segmented by campaign_id. 
* [dsp_impressions](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/dsp_impressions): This data source is used for Amazon DSP traffic. From this table, we are using user_id and impression_dt to identify who was exposed and when, segmented by campaign_id. 
* [conversions_all](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/conversions_all_paid): We use this data source to identify purchase conversion events.

### Insights and data interpretation

**How many ad products are purchasers exposed to? How does that compare to those who did not purchase?** 

On average purchasers are exposed to three ad products (indicated by `ad_products_exposed_per_user`), where as those who did not purchase are exposed to one. Continue multi-media strategy and diversify product mix to reach customer at numerous touch points in the purchase journey.

## Queries

This IQ contains the following queries:

* 4.1 Exploratory query to identify Amazon DSP campaigns
* 4.2 Query template: Compare purchase path from first impression
* 4.3 Query template: Compare purchase path from first search
* 4.4 Query template: Compare purchase path from first detail page view

### Exploratory query to identify Amazon DSP campaigns

Use this query to identify Amazon DSP campaign IDs for use in the queries below. Note that you do not need to identify sponsored ads campaigns; the queries below will grab data for all sponsored ads campaigns, so that you donâ€™t have to enter a long list of campaign IDs.


```
-- Instructional Query: Compare purchase path of converters versus non-converters: (Amazon DSP campaigns) -- 
-- AD PRODUCTS: Amazon DSP
SELECT
advertiser_id,
campaign_id_string,
campaign,
campaign_start_date,
campaign_end_date,
SUM(impressions) AS total_impressions
FROM 
dsp_impressions
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5
```

### Query template: Compare purchase path from first impression

Run this query to evaluate the differences between customers who purchased after ad exposure compared to those that did not purchase.

Note that this query works for Amazon DSP campaigns, sponsored ads campaigns, or both. If you have Amazon DSP campaigns, define the campaign groupings and the campaign IDs identified in the exploratory query.

### Query template: Compare purchase path from first detail page view

Run this query to evaluate the differences between customers who purchased after making a detail page view compared to those that did not purchase.

Note that this query works for Amazon DSP campaigns, sponsored ads campaigns, or both. If you have Amazon DSP campaigns, define the campaign groupings and the campaign IDs identified in the exploratory query.
