## Introduction 

### Purpose 

Cross-purchasing refers to when customers purchase multiple related products. If you are running sponsored ads campaigns, you can analyze cross-purchase patterns to identify the most commonly purchased ASIN pairs, the time gap between their purchases, and segment the analysis by user cohorts (for example, new vs. repeat buyers). With these insights, you can understand how your customers discover and buy complementary items, as well as reveal cross-sell opportunities. 

By leveraging these cross-purchase insights, you can implement:

* Product assortment and bundling recommendations based on real customer purchase affinities
* Tailored marketing campaigns highlighting complementary products
* Inventory forecasting and planning aligned with cross-purchase patterns
* Advertising bid optimization on ASINs with high cross-purchase potential


### Requirements

This query relies on ASIN conversions on Amazon. It is therefore limited to advertisers with on-Amazon conversions. 

To use this IQ, advertisers who sell products on Amazon must invest in sponsored ads product types: Sponsored Brands, Sponsored Products, Sponsored Display or Sponsored TV. To gain comprehensive cross-purchase insights, invest in multiple sponsored ads product types and track conversions across a diverse range of ASINs. 

**Tip:** While analysis can be done with a single ad type or limited ASINs, the insights become more valuable when combining data from multiple sponsored ads tactics and a broader set of products. This provides a holistic view of how customers discover and purchase complementary items through different touchpoints.

## Data query instructions 

### Data returned

The query returns the most commonly purchased ASIN pairs (lead and follow-up ASINs), along with the number of cross-purchased users, total purchases for each ASIN, user reach, and the average number of days between these cross-purchases. 

The data is also segmented by user cohort of new vs. repeat customers. By leveraging these metrics, you can identify prominent product affinities based on real customer journeys driven by sponsored ads, quantify the cross-purchase behavior influenced by your advertising efforts, and gauge the time windows for marketing complementary products. 


### Tables used 

[amazon_attributed_events_by_conversion_time](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/amazon_attributed_events_by_conversion_time): This table contains ad-attributed conversions based on Amazonâ€™s 14-day last touch attribution rule. Wait two weeks past the end of the campaign to run this query to capture all conversions. 
 * Key dimensions used are `user_id`, `tracked_asin`, `ad_product_type`, and `conversion_event_date` to identify purchases influenced by sponsored ads campaigns.
 * The `ad_product_type` dimension is used to differentiate between different sponsored ads products such as Sponsored Brands, Sponsored Products, Sponsored Display, and Sponsored Television.

### Insights and data interpretation

* **What are the top 3 ASIN pairs that customers purchase together?** 

    The top 3 ASIN pairs ranked by the highest number of cross-purchased users are ASIN1234 and ASIN7627 with 558 users, ASIN9898 and ASIN2253 with 417 users, and ASIN9876 and ASIN4326 with 314 users. These product combinations represent the most prominent cross-purchase affinities exhibited by customers. 

    **Action:** For the top cross-purchased ASIN pairs, implement product bundling and marketing campaigns highlighting these complementary items together.

* **For the ASIN pair ranked #1 in cross-purchased users, what was the average number of days between purchases?**

    For the top ranking ASIN pair (ASIN1234 and ASIN7627), the average number of days between when a customer purchased the lead ASIN (ASIN1234) and the follow-up ASIN (ASIN7627) was 31.24 days (`avg_days_between_purchases`).

    **Action:** For top cross-purchased ASIN pairs, set up retargeting campaigns on the follow-up ASIN timed to go live around the `avg_days_between_purchases` window after buyers purchase the lead ASIN. This improves ad relevance and likelihood of conversion by aligning to the typical customer journey.


* **What percentage of cross-purchased users were identified as new customers?**

    A high percentage (78.5% of the total 2,623 cross-purchased users) were identified as "New Customer" in the `user_cohort` dimension. This highlights the importance of attracting new buyers, as a significant portion of valuable cross-purchase behavior is driven by first-time customers. 

    **Action:** Tailor assortment and inventory strategy for new vs repeat buyers based on differing cross-purchase behavior.

* **Which sponsored ads product type had the highest total `lead_asin_purchases` across all ASIN pairs?**

    When analyzing by ad product type, Sponsored Products campaigns drove the highest total of 21,622 lead ASIN purchases across all cross-purchased ASIN pairs. This outpaced Sponsored Display at 9,212, Sponsored Brands at 8,223, and Sponsored Television at 10,390 total lead purchases. This shows the effectiveness of Sponsored Products ads for influencing the initial purchases that kickstart cross-purchase sequences. 

    **Action:** Prioritize ad investment in the channels or products driving the most valuable cross-purchases to maximize customer lifetime value.

## Queries

### Exploratory query

Use this exploratory query to view the list of `ad_product_type` and ASIN purchases in your conversion data. This can help you decide which ad products or ASIN filters you may want to apply to the main ASIN cross-purchase analysis query.



```
-- Exploratory Query: Sponsored ads ASIN cross-purchase --
SELECT
  campaign_id_string,
  ad_product_type,
  tracked_asin,
  SUM(purchases) AS total_purchases
FROM amazon_attributed_events_by_conversion_time
WHERE ad_product_type IN ('sponsored_products','sponsored_brands','sponsored_display','sponsored_television')
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
```
