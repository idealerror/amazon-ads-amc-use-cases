## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Summary

This instructional query (IQ) measures the impact of advertising by quantifying sales derived off-Amazon from ad product exposure. This IQ seeks to answer questions such as: 

* Which ad products are most effective in driving conversions? 
* What is the cost per customer acquisition? 

### 1.2 Purpose

Amazon Ads is an omni-channel partner with the ability to reach customers at multiple touch points in their shopping journey. Leveraging Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC), advertisers can upload off-Amazon transactions into AMC and analyze how exposure to one or more Amazon Ads channels influenced off-Amazon conversion activity.

This query captures all touch points by ad product for each customerâ€™s initial ad-attributed purchase, and their subsequent ad-attributed spend within the queried time period. This query does not consider the order of ad product exposure and does not consider the impression frequency of each product.

This visual below is an example of how the data can be interpreted and illustrated.

![off-amazon conversions path](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/adsamciql/off-amazon-exposure-path.png)

There are two queries:

* **Section 4.2.1** - Highlights Amazon DSP campaigns. Sponsored ads impressions and conversions are included in the analysis by default to avoid users having to manually include tens to hundreds of campaign names. 
* **Section 4.2.2** - Includes sponsored ads campaigns only. Similar to query template 4.2.1, all sponsored ads campaigns are included by default to avoid users having to manually include tens to hundreds of campaign names.

### 1.3 Requirements

* To use this query, you must have uploaded first-party (1P) conversion events to AMC. You can use 1P inputs in conjunction with Amazon Ads events for a variety of measurement and audience use cases. Refer to [Advertiser Data Upload API documentation](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/advertiser-data-upload/advertiser-data-overview) or [AMC Uploader from AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/amazon-marketing-cloud-uploader-from-aws/) for more information.
* You ran Amazon DSP or sponsored ads campaigns over the time period queried. 

## 2. Data query instructions

### 2.1 Data returned

The query will return performance metrics per ad product exposure, including unique customers reached, impressions, impressions cost, off-Amazon converters, and sales. Use the query in section 4.2.1 to highlight Amazon DSP campaigns; you have the ability to customize Ad Products by grouping campaigns. For both queries (section 4.2.1 and 4.2.2), sponsored ads are included by default, requiring no campaign name or ID inputs.

### 2.2 Tables used

* **first_party_conversions_table**: This is a placeholder table name; replace this table name with the name of the conversions table you have uploaded into AMC
    * Refer to [IQ: Introduction to using first-party data in AMC](/marketing-cloud/instructional-queries/f301989fa6543b1b32301fff3b361b45f7e4507d9e214218f81fc187edc10e6b) to learn more about how you can use first-party inputs within AMC.
* [dsp_impressions](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/dsp_impressions): This table provides traffic data for Amazon DSP campaigns.
* [sponsored_ads_traffic](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/sponsored_ads_traffic): This table provides traffic data for sponsored ads campaigns.

| `exposure`                             | Ad product exposure, agnostic of exposure order. Each exposure is mutually exclusive.                                                                                                                                    |
| `audience_reach`                       | Number of distinct users reached. Each unique user is assigned to one exposure group only. For example, a user exposed to DSP, sponsored ads, and PVa would not be assigned to the exposure group DSP and sponsored ads. |
| `impressions`                          | Total impressions each exposure group received over queried time frame.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `total_users_that_purchased`           | Number of unique shoppers who made at least 1 ad-attributed conversion off-Amazon. Each shopper is mutually exclusive.                                                                                                   |

| `total_off_amazon_ad_attributed_sales` | Total off-amazon ad-attributed sales from total_users_that_purchased                                                                                                                                                     |



**Note:** Impression totals will reflect all impressions served to those who did not purchase, but only pre-purchase impressions served to those who did purchase.

### 3.3 Insights and data interpretation

**Which ad products are most effective at driving total sales off-Amazon?**

Running Prime Video ads, Amazon DSP, and Sponsored Products campaigns together has the highest conversion rate and is, therefore, most impactful; increase investment in the aforementioned products to further improve conversion rates.

**Recommendations:**

Create custom audiences focusing on users that were exposed to both PVa and Sponsored Products only. Remarket these customers with Amazon DSP campaigns to drive conversions as the combination of PVa, Sponsored Products, and DSP has had the most success.

## 4. Queries

### 4.1 Exploratory query

Use the query below to identify the Amazon DSP campaigns for use in the query template in section 4.2.1. 

**Note:** You do not need to identify sponsored ads campaigns, as the query template 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 includes all sponsored ads campaigns by default. This eliminates the need to enter campaign names into the template and reduces the chance for error.



```

### 4.2 Query templates

**4.2.1 Amazon DSP and sponsored ads exposure**

Copy and paste the following query into the Query Editor.

Follow the instructions in the query to adjust attribution window and define Amazon DSP products. 

Replace `first_party_conversions_table` with the name of your first party table. This table will need the following columns:

* `user_id`
* `order_id`
