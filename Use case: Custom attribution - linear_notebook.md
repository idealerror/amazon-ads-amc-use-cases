## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

On the path to conversion, customers may interact with multiple ads from the same advertiser. Attribution models let you choose how much credit each ad interaction gets for your conversions. Different attribution models can provide you with a better understanding of how your ads perform and help you optimize across conversion journeys. 

This instructional query (IQ) provides insights on all the touch points of a customer over a campaign period. The linear attribution model gives equal credit to all touch points, providing you with insights on which channels are the most effective in attracting and converting customers. Additionally, this IQ also provides you with the flexibility to customize the lookback window vs. the default 14 day attribution window. Linear custom attribution does not provide path-to-conversion insights. Instead, the results from this query divide the credit equally among all campaigns. If you are interested in path to conversion insights, we recommend the [Path to Conversion Instructional Query](/marketing-cloud/instructional-queries/47b4188b0848e7bf5f0b4417cc5c284fafe7517099431e8a0a26c6fa5911cc88).

Please note this linear attribution model is different from Amazonâ€™s Standard Attribution Model from the `amazon_attributed_events_by_traffic_time` and `amazon_attributed_events_by_conversion_time` tables. For more details on the similarities and differences between the two data sources, please refer the [Custom Attribution Documentation](/marketing-cloud/instructional-queries/72313993a488c7c1821e67c6fdd7a366cd434ef65ea14a2aae4d96fd16a2e627).

### 1.2 Standard reporting vs custom attribution in AMC

| Category | Standard Reporting for Amazon DSP and Sponsored Ads | Custom Attribution in AMC | To Align with Standard Reporting |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Eligible traffic events | Amazon DSP campaigns allow attribution to clicks and views. Sponsored ads allows only clicks for CPC billing (i.e., most sponsored ads campaigns), and clicks and views for vCPM or Fixed Price. | Default is clicks only for Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands, and Sponsored Display. Default is clicks and views for Amazon DSP. For non-view-aware placements, impressions are included by default. Traffic events can be customized for each ad type to include clicks, impressions, or both. | Retain the default of click-only attribution for sponsored ads and click and view attribution for Amazon DSP. sponsored ads CPC placements typically appear in high-intent shopping contexts, where ads are highly viewable and shoppers are already close to converting. Attributing conversions to views in these cases can lead to overcrediting and will shift credit away from ads that directly influenced the purchase. |
| Eligible conversion events | Eligible conversion events are determined by campaign configuration. Conversions for all tracked off-Amazon events, tracked product ASINs, and other ASINs from the same brands can be attributed. "Tracked" refers to events and products associated with the campaign during setup. | Default is all ASINs or off-Amazon Conversion events relevant to the campaigns. Filtering to fewer ASINs or events is customizable. | Retain default inclusion of all relevant ASINs and events manager signals. The default template in the IQ will capture conversions that were indicated as relevant during campaign setup. |
| Attribution window | 14 days (7 days for Sponsored Products for Sellers) | Default is 28 days. Up to 28 days is customizable | 14 days |
| Credit assignment | Amazon's last touch attribution considers each campaign's relevance to the converted product, then uses a last-touch model that prioritizes the last click over the last view. Amazon uses this ranking for last-touch attribution: \* Promoted ASIN ad clicks, \* Highly relevant\*\* brand halo ad clicks, \* Promoted ASIN ad views, \* Highly relevant\*\* brand halo ad views, \* Brand halo ad clicks, \* Brand halo ad views | Default is clicks prioritized over views (or impressions for non-view-aware placements). Customizable to choose last touch, position based, linear, or first touch | Last touch with default of clicks prioritized over views/impressions aligns closely with standard attribution outcomes. |

** Highly relevant refers to ASINs from the same brand and product subcategory as promoted ASINs

### 1.4 Requirements

Your instance should preferably have data from multiple ad campaigns. If you only have one active ad campaign, the query will return results, but they will be limited to the single ad campaign and all the credit will go toward that single ad campaign. The query templates can be used for both ASIN and off_amazon conversion advertisers.


## 2. Query instructions

### 2.1 Tables used

* [dsp_impressions](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/dsp_impressions): We select Amazon DSP impressions from this table.
* [dsp_clicks](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/dsp_clicks): We select Amazon DSP clicks from this table.
* [sponsored_ads_traffic](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/sponsored_ads_traffic): We select sponsored ads impressions and clicks from this table. If you do not have sponsored ads campaigns, the query template has instructions to remove this section to run the query over your Amazon DSP campaigns only.
* [conversions_with_relevance](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/conversions_with_relevance): This table contains combinations of conversion events and campaigns that the conversion was considered relevant to. This data source contains the same conversion events from the `conversions` data source but is expanded such that each row represents a unique combination of conversion event, advertiser, campaign, and relevance. Please note that a conversion could be repeated multiple times if it is relevant to multiple campaigns. We are using this table because it contains the campaign relevance information needed to join traffic events to conversion events and to prioritize traffic events. Please refer to the [Custom Attribution Documentation](/marketing-cloud/instructional-queries/72313993a488c7c1821e67c6fdd7a366cd434ef65ea14a2aae4d96fd16a2e627) for more information on this table.
* [dsp_views](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/dsp_views): This table is used by default to attribute based on Amazon DSP views. The query template has instructions to make the query non-view aware.

### 2.2 Query templates

Query templates are located Sections 4 and 5. Exploratory queries are provided in Section 4 guide you through the process of selecting appropriate query filters for campaigns (required) and ASINs (optional, but recommended for ASIN conversion advertisers).

The custom attribution query template in Section 5 has detailed instructions on changing the following settings:

* **Ad product type combinations**: The query template by default considers Amazon DSP and sponsored ads campaigns. Instructions are provided to focus on Amazon DSP only, Amazon DSP and sponsored ads, or sponsored ads only.
* **Off-Amazon conversions**: There is an option to change the conversion metric to off-Amazon conversions.
* **Adjust the lookback window**: You have the option to include impression and click events from up to X days before conversion events. The default setting is 28 days. It's not recommended to extend the window beyond 28 days for sponsored ads or for Amazon DSP campaigns that promote ASINs, but you can extend this for off_amazon conversions. Please refer to the [Custom Attribution Documentation](/marketing-cloud/instructional-queries/72313993a488c7c1821e67c6fdd7a366cd434ef65ea14a2aae4d96fd16a2e627) for more information.
* **Choose your traffic qualifications**: Do you want to attribute based on impressions or clicks or both? Both are considered by default for Amazon DSP. Clicks are considered by default for ads products. The query template has instructions to adjust this setting.
* **Consider viewability for Amazon DSP campaigns**: The query template considers viewability by default for Amazon DSP campaigns. You have the option to remove the Amazon DSP view-aware section. If you remove this section, the query will not consider viewability. Note that the attributed conversions from `amazon_attributed_events_by_traffic_time` and `amazon_attributed_events_by_conversion_time` consider viewability. If a user was delivered an impression that was not viewable and then converted within a 14-day time period, this conversion would not meet the qualifications to be attributed to a campaign. However, this conversion would appear in the custom attribution if other requirements are satisfied.

### 3.2 Metrics defined

| metric                | definition |
|----------------------|------------|
| impressions          | Number of impressions each campaign received over the campaign period. |
| clicks               | Number of clicks each campaign received over the campaign period. |
| user\_reach          | Number of unique users each campaign reached. |
| users\_that\_converted | Number of unique users who converted. When event\_category = 'purchase', conversions are purchase conversions and this metric is the distinct count of users who purchased. |
| conversions          | Number of conversions over the campaign period. When event\_category = 'purchase', conversions are purchase conversions. |
| conversion\_rate     | Number of distinct users that converted divided by all users reached by the ad. When event\_category = 'purchase', conversions are purchase conversions and this conversion rate is the purchase rate. |
| total\_units\_sold   | The total quantity of promoted products and products from the same brand as promoted products purchased by customers on Amazon after delivering an ad. A campaign can have multiple units sold in a single purchase event. |
| total\_product\_sales | The total sales (in local currency) of promoted ASINs and ASINs from the same brands as promoted ASINs purchased by customers on Amazon after delivering an ad. |

### 3.3 Insights and data interpretation

The linear model shows that users who viewed the Streaming TV awareness campaign (Accent Athletics_OTT_Q2-Q3'21 - OTT - Amazon Guarantee - Awareness) had a 1.72% conversion rate, followed by users who view a lower funnel Conversion DSP Display ad (Accent Athletics_Q2-Q3'21 - Display ads - Amazon DSP - Conversion), with a 0.78% conversion rate. 

Linear attribution splits the credit evenly among the four campaigns. This insight included four campaigns, so there were up to four campaign-distinct touch points before a conversion. When the credit for a conversion is divided equally among all touch points (first, second, third, and last), Streaming TV shows the highest conversion rate.

Consider using the [First Touch Attribution IQ](/marketing-cloud/instructional-queries/578a0a9ec3875507beade48f562e1ae6189fbf6ea203a7d34508cb2e24c6d875), the [Last Touch Attribution IQ](/marketing-cloud/instructional-queries/e793be327be2aa9f4fbdbdcaf3f3f822ed8819440beb15f94b377b07b08cf0bf), and the [Position Based Attribution IQ](/marketing-cloud/instructional-queries/cdf597257dcf43b65c1af8dd14480433e4dbe513469575e8b064f62029c94e9b) to supplement this analysis and compare results.


## 4. Exploratory queries

Exploratory queries help you to understand what campaigns were running during a given time period and what ASINs or off_amazon conversions were tracked. The two queries in Section 4 do not provide the attributed results. This query is in section 5.

### 4.1 Exploratory query for advertisers with ASIN conversions

Advertisers who track ASINs should run the query below to explore the campaigns and ASINs available in your instance for analysis. This step will help you to select the appropriate filters to add to the rule-based attribution query in Section 5.

### 4.2 Exploratory query for advertisers with off-Amazon conversions

Advertisers who track off-Amazon conversions should run the query below to explore the campaigns available in your instance for analysis. This step will help you to select the appropriate filters to add to the linear attribution queries. The query below is for exploratory purposes only and will pull conversions from users that had both viewable and non-viewable impressions.


```

       Unlike ASIN conversions, off_amazon conversions are not subject to the 28-day lookback window.*/
      EXTEND_TIME_WINDOW('dsp_impressions', 'P60D', 'P0D')
    )

```

## 5. Custom attribution query template - Linear attribution

The query below by default works over sponsored ads and Amazon DSP campaigns. It can be customized for off-Amazon conversion advertisers, Amazon DSP-only advertisers, and for sponsored ads only. The technical customization instructions are included at the top of the query and are also summarized in Section 2.2.


```
-- Instructional Query: Custom Attribution - Linear Touch --
/*
 ------- Customization Instructions -------
 1) All advertisers should run the exploratory query first to select the appropriate campaign filters (required) and ASIN filters 
 (optional, but recommended for ASIN advertisers). Campaigns are updated at the top of the query. Search 'ASIN' to find ASIN filters.
 2) To run this query across DSP and sponsored ads campaigns, search 'UPDATE' to identify all filters to update. Do not remove any sections.
 3) To run this query across DSP campaigns only, search 'sponsored ads-specific'. Delete the sponsored ads sections. 
 Then search 'UPDATE' to update the remaining sections of the query.
 4) To run this query across DSP campaigns only for off-Amazon conversions, follow the instructions from #3. 
 Then search for 'off-amazon' in this query to change the conversion metric to off-Amazon conversions. 
 You have the option to remove the calculated value for total_units_sold and total_product_sales, since they will not return values 
 for off-Amazon conversions.
 5) This query is view-aware by default for DSP campaigns. 
 To make this query non-view-aware for DSP campaigns, search 'DSP view-aware'. Remove this section.
 6a) This query considers views and clicks for DSP.
 The query will prioritize clicks over impressions. To only consider clicks for DSP attribution, search for 'UPDATE DSP Traffic Qualifications'.
 6b) This query considers clicks only for Sponsored Products.
 If you want to consider both clicks and impressions for Sponsored Products and prioritize clicks over impressions, search for 'UPDATE SP Traffic Qualifications'.
 6c) This query considers clicks only for Sponsored Display.
 If you want to consider both clicks and impressions for Sponsored Display and prioritize clicks over impressions, search for 'UPDATE SD Traffic Qualifications'.
 6d) This query considers clicks only for Sponsored Brands.
 If you want to consider both clicks and impressions for Sponsored Brands and prioritize clicks over impressions, search for 'UPDATE SB Traffic Qualifications'. This query considers clicks and impressions for Sponsored TV. Note: Clicks and impressions are not deduplicated for the same Sponsored TV impression.
 This query considers clicks and impressions for Sponsored TV. Note: Clicks and impressions are not deduplicated for the same Sponsored TV impression.
 6e) To change the traffic priority and make clicks and impression equal, search 'UPDATE traffic priority'.
 7) To run this query across sponsored ads campaigns only, search 'DSP-specific'. Delete the three DSP sections. 
 Then search 'UPDATE' to update the remaining sections of the query.
 8) To change the lookback window from the default setting of 28 days, search 'UPDATE Lookback Window' for instructions.
