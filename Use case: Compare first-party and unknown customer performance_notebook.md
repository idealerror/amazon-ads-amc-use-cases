## Introduction 

### Purpose 

This instructional query (IQ) helps you analyze the reach and performance of your Amazon Ads campaigns in the context of your known first-party (1P) customer set. You can use this template to understand how your Amazon Ads media delivery is distributed across 1P (known) and other (unknown) audiences, as well as compare performance between the two groups. In this context, your 1P known audience could be, for example, those who have transacted via your retail site or with whom you have a pre-existing customer relationship; everyone outside of this 1P audience would be classified as unknown. These insights may be helpful if you are looking to assess how well your campaigns are reaching your known customers, or (if your campaign is more focused on growth of your customer set) how well your campaigns are reaching net-new customers.

### Requirements 

To use this query, you must have uploaded 1P inputs, such as an audience table, to AMC. You can use 1P inputs in conjunction with Amazon Ads events for a variety of measurement and audience use cases. For more details, see [Instructional query: Introduction to using first-party data in AMC](/marketing-cloud/instructional-queries/f301989fa6543b1b32301fff3b361b45f7e4507d9e214218f81fc187edc10e6b). 

You must also have had at least one active Amazon Ads campaign during the time frame you choose for your analysis. However, while the query does include `ad_product_type` as a dimension to differentiate results based on Amazon Ads channel (Amazon DSP, Sponsored Products, Sponsored Display, and Sponsored Brands), note that you do not need to be running campaigns in more than one channel to use this query.

## Data query instructions 

### Data returned

The query returns delivery and performance metrics for known customers (the audience that you uploaded to AMC) vs. all other (unknown) customers. You can customize which campaigns and ad product types you include, along with which type of conversion events are relevant for you.

### Tables used

- **first_party_audience_table** is a placeholder table name; replace this table name with the name of the audience table you have uploaded to AMC.
  - Note: 1P tables show up under the **Advertiser uploaded** section of the AMC UIâ€™s **Schema explorer**. Refer to [Instructional query: Introduction to using first-party data in AMC](/marketing-cloud/instructional-queries/f301989fa6543b1b32301fff3b361b45f7e4507d9e214218f81fc187edc10e6b) to learn more about how you can use first-party inputs within AMC.
- **[dsp_impressions](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/dsp_impressions)** and/or **[sponsored_ads_traffic](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/sponsored_ads_traffic)** tables are used to gather the impression exposure events.
- **[amazon_attributed_events_by_traffic_time](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/datasources/amazon_attributed_events_by_conversion_time)** is used to join in-conversion events.

### Insights and data interpretation

This IQ will help you understand how performance compares from your known customers (the audience that you uploaded to AMC) versus all other (unknown) customers, per ad product.

**What is the purchase rate for known customers versus unknown customers, per ad product?**

For my Amazon DSP campaigns, known customers purchased at a rate of 0.43%, while unknown customers purchased at a rate of 0.21%. My known customers are more likely to purchase than unknown customers.

**What percent of my known customer set have I been able to reach per ad product type?**

I was able to reach 53% of my known customers on Amazon DSP, 35.01% on Sponsored Products, 26.01% on Sponsored Display, and 17.09% on Sponsored Brands. This can be a helpful insight depending on your business goals and your campaign set up: Are you trying to reach existing, known customers, or are you trying to grow your brand by reaching net-new audiences? 

**How much am I spending, per ad product, on known vs. unknown customers?**

For my Sponsored Brand campaigns, 5.75% of my total SB spend was on reaching known customers, vs. 94.25% on reaching unknown customers. My tactics are doing well at reaching net-new customers.
